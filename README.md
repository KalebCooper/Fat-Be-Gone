## FAQ

- What was your reason for making this app?
  - I made this app because I myself have lost over 100 pounds in 2017 by counting calories. I wanted to create an app that could help allow other people to change their lives for the better just like I have done. I looked at many weight loss apps on the app store and they all were missing a few features that I liked (BMI Calculator, customized notification times, etc.), so I made my own!
